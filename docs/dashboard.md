Simulated Hospital includes a built-in web app (called **Dashboard**) to manage
running instances. This document explains how you can manage Simulated Hospital
from your browser.

Using Simulated Hospital's dashboard, you can do the following:

*   Change the message-sending rate of a self-running simulation.
*   Start an ad-hoc pathway or send an HL7 message.

## Open the dashboard

After Simulated Hospital finishes launching, you can visit
http://localhost:8000/simulated-hospital/ in your browser. If you're running
Simulated Hospital on another computer, replace _localhost_ with the hostname or
IP address of the other computer.

To change the TCP port or URL path, launch Simulated Hospital with the
`dashboard_address` and `dashboard_uri`
[command-line arguments](./arguments.md#dashboard).

## Simulation rate

Simulated Hospital typically runs your pathways as part of a self-running
simulation. Each new pathway represents a patient arriving to the hospital. The
application distributes pathways evenly across the hour. For example, if you set
the rate to 10, Simulated Hospital starts a pathway every 6 minutes. To change
how often Simulated Hospital runs your pathways, follow these steps:

1.  Open the dashboard in your browser.
1.  Drag the *New Pathways per Hour* slider to your new rate.

Your new rate only affects starting new pathways. Existing pathways continue
generating and sending new HL7 messages until the pathway completeâ€”even if your
set the rate to zero.

The initial value at startup is determined by the
[`pathways_per_hour`](./arguments.md#pathways) argument.

### Set the rate programmatically

You can set higher message-sending rates from the command line. Run the
following command (you might need to change the host, port, or path) in your
terminal:

```shell
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:8000/simulated-hospital/pathwayRate -d 'value=2000'
```

## Run a pathway

You might want to run a pathway immediately to demonstrate a feature or test
during development. You can run a pathway by entering one of the following:

*   The name of a [pre-loaded pathway](#pre-loaded-pathways). For example,
    `aki_scenario_1`. Either, append a colon and MRN if you want to update an
    existing patient, or, append a colon with first and last names to override
    the name included in the pathway.
*   The source of a pathway in YAML or JSON format. Simulated Hospital validates
    your data before running. To learn more, read
    [Write pathways](./write-pathways.md).

Here are some examples:

```yaml
# A pathway using ramdomized or built-in data.
aki_scenario_1

# A pathway with patient MRN to update an existing (or create a new) patient.
aki_scenario_1: 123456789012345

# A pathway to create a new patient with the name Jane Doe.
aki_scenario_1: Jane Doe

# Pathway source admitting a patient into the Renal ward, in YAML.
admission_example:
  persons:
      main_patient:
        mrn: "123456789012345"
        first_name: "Elizabeth"
        surname: "Smith"
  pathway:
    - admission:
        loc: Renal

# Pathway source admitting a patient into the Renal ward, in JSON.
{
  "admission_example": {
    "persons": {
      "main_patient": {
        "mrn": "123456789012345",
        "first_name": "Elizabeth",
        "surname": "Smith"
      }
    },
    "pathway": [
      {
        "admission": {
          "loc": "Renal"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When you run a pathway from the dashboard, Simulated Hospital runs the pathway
once. If you want to repeatedly run a pathway, add the pathway to the pre-loaded
pathways.

To run a pathway, follow these steps:

1.  Open the dashboard in your browser.
1.  Enter the pathway name or source into the text area.
1.  Click **Run or Send**.

After running a pathway, Simulated Hospital shows the patient's name and MRN
below the text area.

## Send a raw message

To send a raw HL7v2 message, follow these steps:

1.  Open the dashboard in your browser.
1.  Enter the HL7 message into the text area.
1.  Click **Run or Send**.

HL7 messages should look similar to the following example:

```txt
MSH|^~\&|FROM_APP|FROM_FACILITY|TO_APP|TO_FACILITY|20180101000000||ADT^A01|20180101000000|P|2.5|
EVN|A01|20110613083617|
PID|1|843125^^^^MRN|21004053^^^^MRN~2269030303^^^^ORGNMBR||SULLY^BRIAN||19611209|M|||123 MAIN ST^^CITY^STATE^12345|
PV1||I|H73 RM1^1^^HIGHWAY 01 CLINIC||||5148^MARY QUINN|||||||||Y||||||||||||||||||||||||||||20180101000000|
```

Before sending, check the following:

*   Each segment must starts on a new line. The example shows four segments.
*   You can include more than one message, but separate each message with a
    blank line.

Simulated Hospital checks that the raw HL7 message can be parsed before sending
it.
